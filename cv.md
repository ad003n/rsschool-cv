# Code Example
 **from CODEWARS**

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
```cpp
int solution(int number) {
  if (number < 0) return 0;
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

## Projects 
Desktop application for working with maps. It allows setting start and end points of a route, moving them, and automatically generating intermediate markers between them with a specified step distance. Additional points are created between all markers. Any marker (start, end, intermediate, or additional) can be moved, and when moved, an additional marker becomes a main one.
